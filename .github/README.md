# Nibbler-42

This 42 school projet aims to get a better understanding of shared objects. It's about coding a Snake-like game in C++ and using dlopen() C syscall's to dynamically load graphic library on the go. We must have at least 3 different graphic libraries.

I used c++20 to build this project and the 3 libraries are : 
- ncurses (terminal based)
- SDL2
- raylib

Bonus for nibbler are : adding more game modes, adding a sound library (still compiled in a shared object and opened in game), add a local multiplayer and finally add a network based multiplayer.
